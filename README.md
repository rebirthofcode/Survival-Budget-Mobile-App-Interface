## 📱 What is Survival Budget?

Survival Budget is a budgeting app that prioritizes your expenses in order of importance:

1. **Survival** - Rent, food, utilities, healthcare (non-negotiable essentials)
2. **Important** - Transportation, phone, insurance (important for daily life)
3. **Quality of Life** - Dining out, entertainment, subscriptions (nice to have)
4. **Future Building** - Savings, investments, debt payoff (building wealth)

The app automatically calculates what you can afford at each level based on your income, helping you make informed decisions when money gets tight.
