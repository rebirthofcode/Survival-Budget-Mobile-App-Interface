## Known Limitations (Beta v1)

### Current Constraints
1. **Beta Data Collection**
   - Data stored locally only
   - No backend tracking (yet)
   - Recommend adding analytics

2. **Single Income Source**
   - PRD v4 multi-income not yet integrated
   - Works perfectly for single income
   - Migration ready when needed

3. **No Export Feature**
   - Can't export budget data yet
   - On roadmap for v1.1

4. **Desktop Experience**
   - Optimized for mobile
   - Works on desktop but designed mobile-first

### Not Bugs (By Design)
- Beta gate can be bypassed by clearing localStorage (acceptable for beta)
- No email verification (not needed for beta testing)
- Contact email is placeholder (update before deploy)

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### What to Track

1. **Beta Sign-ups**
   - Add Google Analytics event
   - Or add backend endpoint

   - Where users drop off
   - Average session duration

3. **Technical Issues**

   - Failed API calls
   - Browser compatibility

### Recommended Tools
